Chameleon System SanityCheckBundle
==================================

The SanityCheckBundle adds support for checks that aid you in finding common problems when running your application.
For example, you can ensure that there is enough disk space, or permissions on certain files are granted. With this bundle
you can configure checks that verify that the requirements for running the applications are met.

Where these checks are performed is up to you. In an installer, from the command line or an admin interface - just add
the checks wherever they suit your needs.
